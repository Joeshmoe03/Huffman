REFLECTIONS/CONSIDERATIONS:
- I found myself heavily dependant upon the hints/explanations provided on the canvas discussion thread when implementing buildHuffmanTree(). Should practice this in the future...
- Is my clearColumn method actually necessary? I figure its a good idea to delete the QTableWidgetItems before hiding and replacing them with new items. It was specified to hide the columns, but is this also then necessary?
- File/IO stuff was fairly straightforward with the previous lecture references. Major source of confusion was largely the encoding scheme as I had never taken algorithms in prior semester.
